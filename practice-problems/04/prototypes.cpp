/* Function *prototypes* might seem unnecessary -- after all, as long as you
 * place the function earlier in your file than the places you use it, it'll
 * compile just fine.
 * TODO: come up with a situation where at least one function prototype is
 * *strictly necessary*.  Write functions which demonstrate your idea and
 * make sure what you wrote actually compiles (and will not compile without
 * any function prototypes).
 * BTW, if you need a reminder about prototypes, read here:
