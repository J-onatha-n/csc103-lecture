/* TODO: write a function which takes two vectors of integers V1 and V2,
 * *which you assume will be SORTED*.  (That is, i<=j ==> V1[i]<=V1[j], and
 * similarly for V2).  The function should merge these two vectors into a
 * third vector which is also sorted.
 * NOTE: do NOT do this by just adding all elements into the 3rd vector and
 * then sorting that.  You can do this much more efficiently since the input
 * vectors are sorted already.  Your function should take a number of steps
 * proportional to the sum of the sizes of V1 and V2.  */
