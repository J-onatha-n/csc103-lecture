/* TODO: write a program that computes the following strange thing:
 * the difference of the sum of all the evens and the odds.  E.g. if
 * the input were 4 7 6 then the output would be 3 (= (4+6) - 7).
 * You can figure out even oddness by using the % operator which computes
 * the *remainder* of a division.
 * Bonus question (easy):  can you do this without keeping track of two
 * different sums?
 * Bonus question (might be non-obvious): can you do this without any
 * if statements? */
